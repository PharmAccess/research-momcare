The interface provides users with a broad overview of the datasets included in the DS-I Africa consortium. These include datasets from research hubs and research projects. This broad overview consists of specific metadata fields at the project and dataset levels. Dataset-level metadata fields differ based on the dataset types within the consortium. In addition, the eLwazi Catalogue also provides the same level of information for external projects (not within the DS-I Africa consortium) which use eLwazi as a Cloud solution and have completed an eLwazi Use Agreement.";
